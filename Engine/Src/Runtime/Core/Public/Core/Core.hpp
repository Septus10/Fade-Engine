/* Class and struct prefixes
* C = Regular classes
* S = Regular structs
* T = Templated classes or structs
* I = Interface

/* Variable prefixes
* s_ = Static variable
* g_ = Global variable
* m_ = Member variable
* a_ = Function argument/parameter
*
* Prefixes can be combined, they are, however,
* to be combined using their proper word order.
* Examples:
* sm_ = Static member variable
* sg_ = Static global variable
*
* Local variables do not have a prefix
